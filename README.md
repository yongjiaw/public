Other Comments
--------------------------
The quick start commandline is based on SBT, which takes extra time since the compiler will check the source code every time.<BR>
This is more flexible for development, but not good for deployment.<BR>
A separate deployment process can be setup to release and deploy the binary jar artifacts in customized ways.
